## Prototype 2

This is the second prototype for MDS's rapid prototype paper year 2 semester 2.
As a team we were giving the following brief:

- We need to create a game based on Nutrition
- We cannot give text feedback whatsoever (Except using Symbols/Or text in our main menu).

### Contributers:

We have a group of developers and artists working on the current prototype:
- Tim (Developer)
- Stef (Developer)
- Darren (Artist)
- Lucille (Artist)
- Seb (Artist)

More details on the project will come soon once our prototype has been completed over the next week.
