## Prototype 2 | Nu-treetion

This is the second prototype for MDS's rapid prototype paper year 2 semester 2.
As a team we were giving the following brief:

- We need to create a game based on Nutrition
- We cannot give text feedback whatsoever (Except using Symbols/Or text in our main menu).

### Contributers:

We have a group of developers and artists working on the current prototype:
- Tim (Developer)
- Stef (Developer)
- Darren (Artist)
- Lucille (Artist)
- Seb (Artist)

### Gameplay:

Your aim it to gain a 5 star score by eating healthy food.
The stars will lower if you eat unhealthy food. Recipes
allow the player to gain 5 stars quicker. The game has basic
movement (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

If unsure how to play game, there are instructions within the
menu.
